284950,Pixel Puzzles: Japan,"Its ok for what it is aldow i would not recommend it for a couple of reasons. The first puzzles work just fine the puzzles in the end are frustrating because you keep clicking on that 1 piece you want to pick up only to keep getting the one below it, and also the lack of a save feature i dont get its not like i cant walk away from a puzzle in real life to come back to it later on, well in this game you have to complete it or start over  a button to reset the puzzle rly? why would anyone wanna do that its not like its possible to make mistakes in a puzzle you eather got it or you dont  the puzzles themselves are nice and relaxing, the japanese music i like its relaxing so if you dont mind the biggest minus point of having no save feature you should stil have some good fun with it  i give it 5/10, 8/10 if they add a save feature and 9/10 if they make picking up the piece i want to pick up work",-1,0

2600,Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines,Very good game and very good adaption of the system and captures the feel of the world of darkenss very well. A few areas with lots of repetitive combat slightly take the shine off the things but still very good game. Consider installing some of the very good mods.,1,0
